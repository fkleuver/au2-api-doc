# &#128366; Summary

TargetedInstructionType enum values become the property names for the associated renderers when they are injected
into the `Renderer`.
Additional instruction types can be added as long as they are 2 characters long and do not clash with existing ones.
By convention, the instruction types for a particular runtime start with the same first letter, and the second letter
starts counting from letter `a`. The standard runtime instruction types all start with the letter `r`.
